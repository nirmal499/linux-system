For debugging use -g flag when compiling with gcc

SOME GDB COMMANDS:

1. gdb ./a.out
2. break main OR break line_number
3. run OR run argument_passed_in argv : e.g run 9
4. next : execute the next line and shows you the next line that is to be executed
5. print variable_name
6. watch variable_name : Whenever the variable changes it shows you the old value and the new value
7. x/20bd : 20bd says the size we want
to read is 20, and we want to present it in groups of bytes (the b) and print the content
using decimal notation (the d)

8. set text[5] = 'y'
9. set text[19] = '\0'

10. continue :  we can use the continue command to let the program run until the end
11. quit : Quit from the gdb
